My portfolio website. 

Hello all, this is my first website; the start of my portfolio/personel website. There are three pages total; a home page, 
a "my work" page, and a contact page. The home page currecntly has an about section where I talk about myself. The "my work" 
page is where links to the websites I am going to create will be located. The contact page is a basic form that once submitted
will redirect the user to a thank you page. Any suggested changes will be more than appreciated!
